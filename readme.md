## Conference-demo-Spring-boot-application
Based on the Pluralsight course [Spring Framework: Creating Your First Spring Boot Application](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/8daf59da-31d4-4a6a-85d8-511b14cf85e1/table-of-contents) by Dan Bunker

### Information
This is a simple Spring boot application that exposes API endpoints to get information about conferences

### Database
The database from this application can be downloaded at [Pluralsight Spring Boot Application Resources](https://github.com/dlbunker/ps-first-spring-boot-app)The Pluralsight course uses PostgreSQL as the database, I have used MySQL instead

We have multiple tables, but the only ones used in the API endpoints are `sessions` and `speakers`
